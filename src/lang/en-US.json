We develop a culture of informal lifelong learning by providing high-quality long-term training courses. Since 2022, we have been conducting art therapies with qualified psychotherapists in Lviv and the region with the support of UNICEF. The CE network exists thanks to the close cooperation of the City Institute, Lviv City Council, the Department of Culture, and the financial support of DVV International Ukraine."
